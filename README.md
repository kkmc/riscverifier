# RISC-Verifier
A translator from RISC-V binary to Uclid5.

#Installation

## Pre-requisites

You will need to install uclid5 and riscv-gnu-toolchain [riscv](https://github.com/riscv). Make sure you have an alias to the compiler and disassembler (riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump). You may optionally use the -p option in uclid to create macros for get field operations.
